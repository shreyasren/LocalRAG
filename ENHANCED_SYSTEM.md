# Enhanced LocalRAG System - Technical Document Processing

## üéØ Problem Summary

The original LocalRAG system had issues with technical document processing that resulted in empty/low-confidence answers:

- ‚ùå **Poor chunking strategy** - headers and metadata mixed with technical content
- ‚ùå **Fragmented technical information** - important content split across chunks  
- ‚ùå **Low-quality context** - vector search returned header-heavy chunks instead of technical content
- ‚ùå **Weak answer extraction** - transformer models received poor context

## ‚úÖ Enhanced Solution

### 1. **TechnicalDocumentProcessor**
- **Smart text cleaning** - Removes headers/metadata while preserving technical content
- **Section-aware chunking** - Identifies and preserves technical sections (Requirements, Tables, Features)
- **Context preservation** - Keeps section titles with content for better understanding

### 2. **EnhancedVectorSearch**  
- **Context expansion** - Groups related chunks from the same section
- **Technical relevance scoring** - Prioritizes chunks with technical indicators
- **Header penalty** - Reduces score for header-heavy content

### 3. **Enhanced Context Creation**
- **Smart context formatting** - Adds section headers to chunks
- **Length optimization** - Prioritizes high-relevance content within token limits
- **Technical content focus** - Emphasizes requirements, signals, and structured data

## üîß Key Features

### **Technical Content Recognition**
Identifies and prioritizes:
- Requirements (R: 2.3.18.1.7a)
- Signal definitions (Headlamps_Command = HIGH)
- Tables and figures
- Feature behavior descriptions
- CAN signal translations

### **Improved Chunking Strategy**
- Preserves section boundaries
- Maintains technical context
- Removes metadata noise
- Groups related information

### **Enhanced Search & Ranking**
- Semantic similarity + technical relevance
- Section-based context expansion
- Header/metadata filtering
- Multi-factor scoring

## üìä Before vs After

### **Before (Original System)**
```
Chunk: "Body Control Module FS-RU5T-14B476-AGL All copies uncontrolled..."
Answer: "" (confidence: 0.00)
```

### **After (Enhanced System)**  
```
Chunk: "[R: 2.3.18.1.7a] BCM shall control headlight signals: HIGH, LOW, OFF..."
Answer: "HIGH, LOW, and OFF commands" (higher confidence expected)
```

## üöÄ Usage

The enhanced system is now integrated into the main LocalRAG system:

```bash
# Process documents (now with enhanced chunking)
python doc-qa-local.py process --document bcm.pdf --cpu

# Query documents (now with enhanced search & context)
python doc-qa-local.py query --cpu
```

## üìã Technical Implementation

### **Enhanced Patterns**
- Header detection: `FS-RU5T-\d+\w*-\w+`, `Page \d+ of \d+`, etc.
- Technical indicators: `R: \d+\.\d+`, `_Command\s*=`, `BCM\s+shall`, etc.
- Section extraction: Requirements, Tables, Features, Figures

### **Scoring Algorithm**
```python
final_score = base_similarity + technical_match_bonus + structure_bonus - header_penalty
```

### **Context Creation**
```python
context = f"[{section_title}]\n{chunk_content}"
```

## üéâ Expected Improvements

1. **Higher answer confidence** - Better context leads to more confident transformer predictions
2. **More relevant answers** - Technical content prioritization  
3. **Better section awareness** - Preserved document structure
4. **Reduced noise** - Filtered headers and metadata
5. **Improved technical Q&A** - Optimized for automotive/technical documents

The enhanced system should now provide much better answers for technical questions about headlight signals, BCM functionality, and other automotive system topics!
